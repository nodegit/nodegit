libgit2 - the Git linkable library
======================

libgit2 is a portable, pure C implementation of the Git core methods provided as a
re-entrant linkable library with a solid API, allowing you to write native
speed custom Git applications in any language with bindings.

libgit2 is licensed under a **very permissive license** (GPLv2 with a special Linking Exception).
This basically means that you can link it (unmodified) with any kind of software without having to
release its source code.

* Usage guide: <http://libgit2.github.com/api.html>

What It Can Do
==================================

libgit2 is already very usable.

* SHA conversions, formatting and shortening
* abstracked ODB backend system
* commit, tag, tree and blob parsing, editing, and write-back
* tree traversal
* revision walking
* index file (staging area) manipulation
* reference management (including packed references)
* config file management
* high level repository management
* thread safety and reentrancy
* descriptive and detailed error messages
* ...and more (over 175 different API calls)

Building libgit2 - Using CMake
==============================

libgit2 builds cleanly on most platforms without any external dependencies.
Under Unix-like systems, like Linux, * BSD and Mac OS X, libgit2 expects `pthreads` to be available;
they should be installed by default on all systems. Under Windows, libgit2 uses the native Windows API
for threading.

The libgit2 library is built using CMake 2.6+ (<http://www.cmake.org>) on all platforms.

On most systems you can build the library using the following commands

	$ mkdir build && cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ cmake --build .

Alternatively you can point the CMake GUI tool to the CMakeLists.txt file and generate platform specific build project or IDE workspace.

To install the library you can specify the install prefix by setting:

	$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/prefix
	$ cmake --build . --target install

For more advanced use or questions about CMake please read <http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_FAQ>.

The following CMake variables are declared:

- `INSTALL_BIN`: Where to install binaries to.
- `INSTALL_LIB`: Where to install libraries to.
- `INSTALL_INC`: Where to install headers to.
- `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`: Build libgit2 as a Shared Library (defaults to ON)
- `BUILD_TESTS`: Build the libgit2 test suite (defaults to ON)
- `THREADSAFE`: Build libgit2 with threading support (defaults to OFF)
