// [**libgit2**][lg] is a portable, pure C implementation of the Git core methods
// provided as a re-entrant linkable library with a solid API, allowing you
// to write native speed custom Git applications in any language which
// supports C bindings.
//
// This file is an example of using that API in a real, compilable C file.
// As the API is updated, this file will be updated to demonstrate the
// new functionality.
//
// If you're trying to write something in C using [libgit2][lg], you will also want
// to check out the generated [API documentation][ap] and the [Usage Guide][ug]. We've
// tried to link to the relevant sections of the API docs in each section in this file.
//
// **libgit2** only implements the core plumbing functions, not really the higher
// level porcelain stuff. For a primer on Git Internals that you will need to know
// to work with Git at this level, check out [Chapter 9][pg] of the Pro Git book.

// ### Includes

// Including the `git2.h` header will include all the other libgit2 headers that you need.
// It should be the only thing you need to include in order to compile properly and get
// all the libgit2 API.

  // ### Opening the Repository

  // There are a couple of methods for opening a repository, this being the simplest.
  // There are also [methods][me] for specifying the index file and work tree locations, here
  // we are assuming they are in the normal places.
  //
  // [me]: http://libgit2.github.com/libgit2/#HEAD/group/repository
  git_repository *repo;
  git_repository_open(&repo, "/opt/libgit2-test/.git");

  // ### SHA-1 Value Conversions

  // For our first example, we will convert a 40 character hex value to the 20 byte raw SHA1 value.
  printf("*Hex to Raw*\n");
  char hex[] = "fd6e612585290339ea8bf39c692a7ff6a29cb7c3";

  // The `git_oid` is the structure that keeps the SHA value. We will use this throughout the example
  // for storing the value of the current SHA key we're working with.
  git_oid oid;
  git_oid_fromstr(&oid, hex);

  // Once we've converted the string into the oid value, we can get the raw value of the SHA.
  printf("Raw 20 bytes: [%s]\n", (&oid)->id);

  // Next we will convert the 20 byte raw SHA1 value to a human readable 40 char hex value.
  printf("\n*Raw to Hex*\n");
  char out[41];
  out[40] = '\0';

  // If you have a oid, you can easily get the hex value of the SHA as well.
  git_oid_fmt(out, &oid);
  printf("SHA hex string: %s\n", out);

  // ### Working with the Object Database
  // **libgit2** provides [direct access][odb] to the object database.
  // The object database is where the actual objects are stored in Git. For
  // working with raw objects, we'll need to get this structure from the
  // repository.
  // [odb]: http://libgit2.github.com/libgit2/#HEAD/group/odb
  git_odb *odb;
  odb = git_repository_database(repo);

  // #### Raw Object Reading

  printf("\n*Raw Object Read*\n");

  git_otype otype;
  const unsigned char *data;
  const char *str_type;
  int error;

  // We can read raw objects directly from the object database if we have the oid (SHA)
  // of the object.  This allows us to access objects without knowing thier type and inspect
  // the raw bytes unparsed.
  error = git_odb_read(&obj, odb, &oid);

  // A raw object only has three properties - the type (commit, blob, tree or tag), the size
  // of the raw data and the raw, unparsed data itself.  For a commit or tag, that raw data
  // is human readable plain ASCII text. For a blob it is just file contents, so it could be
  // text or binary data. For a tree it is a special binary format, so it's unlikely to be
  // hugely helpful as a raw object.
  data = (const unsigned char *)git_odb_object_data(obj);
  otype = git_odb_object_type(obj);

  // We provide methods to convert from the object type which is an enum, to a string
  // representation of that value (and vice-versa).
  str_type = git_object_type2string(otype);

  // For proper memory management, close the object when you are done with it or it will leak
  // memory.
  git_odb_object_close(obj);

  // #### Raw Object Writing

  printf("\n*Raw Object Write*\n");

  // You can also write raw object data to Git. This is pretty cool because it gives you
  // direct access to the key/value properties of Git.  Here we'll write a new blob object
  // that just contains a simple string.  Notice that we have to specify the object type as
  // the `git_otype` enum.
  git_odb_write(&oid, odb, "test data", sizeof("test data") - 1, GIT_OBJ_BLOB);

  // Now that we've written the object, we can check out what SHA1 was generated when the
  // object was written to our database.
  git_oid_fmt(out, &oid);
  printf("Written Object: %s\n", out);

  // ### Object Parsing
  // libgit2 has methods to parse every object type in Git so you don't have to work directly
  // with the raw data. This is much faster and simpler than trying to deal with the raw data
  // yourself.

  // #### Commit Parsing
  // [Parsing commit objects][pco] is simple and gives you access to all the data in the commit
  // - the // author (name, email, datetime), committer (same), tree, message, encoding and parent(s).

  // Commits can have zero or more parents. The first (root) commit will have no parents, most commits

  // #### Writing Commits
  //
  // libgit2 provides a couple of methods to create commit objects easily as well. There are four

  printf("New Commit: %s\n", out);

  // #### Tag Parsing
  // You can parse and create tags with the [tag management API][tm], which functions very similarly
  // to the commit lookup, parsing and creation methods, since the objects themselves are very similar.
  // [tm]: http://libgit2.github.com/libgit2/#HEAD/group/tag

  git_commit_close(commit);

  // #### Tree Parsing
  // [Tree parsing][tp] is a bit different than the other objects, in that we have a subtype which is the
  // tree entry.  This is not an actual object type in Git, but a useful structure for parsing and
  // traversing tree entries.

  // #### Blob Parsing
  //
  // The last object type is the simplest and requires the least parsing help. Blobs are just file
  // contents and can contain anything, there is no structure to it. The main advantage to using the
  // [simple blob api][ba] is that when you're creating blobs you don't have to calculate the size
  // of the content.  There is also a helper for reading a file from disk and writing it to the db and
  // getting the oid back so you don't have to do all those steps yourself.

  // ### Revwalking
  //
  // The libgit2 [revision walking api][rw] provides methods to traverse the directed graph created
  // by the parent pointers of the commit objects.  Since all commits point back to the commit that
  // came directly before them, you can walk this parentage as a graph and find all the commits that
  // were ancestors of (reachable from) a given starting point.  This can allow you to create `git log`
