    Topic: Code Conventions

        - Every package function is called with an arrow operator.  It's needed for inheritance in some places, and consistency
         when it's not.

        - No constant will ever be zero or undef.  Those are reserved so any piece of code can allow a "none of the above" option
         and not worry about conflicts with an existing value.

        - Existence hashes are hashes where the value doesn't matter.  It acts more as a set, where the existence of the key is
         the significant part.


    Topic: File Format Conventions

        - All integers appear in big-endian format.  So a UInt16 should be handled with a 'n' in pack and unpack, not with a 'S'.

        - AString16's are a big-endian UInt16 followed by that many ASCII characters.  A null-terminator is not stored.

        - If a higher-level type is described in a file format, that means the loading and saving format is handled by that package.
         For example, if you see <SymbolString> in the format, that means <NaturalDocs::SymbolString->ToBinaryFile()> and
         <NaturalDocs::SymbolString->FromBinaryFile()> are used to manipulate it, and the underlying format should be treated
         as opaque.

#
#   Group: Basic Types
#
#   Types used throughout the program.  As Perl is a weakly-typed language unless you box things into objects, these types are
#   for documentation purposes and are not enforced.
#
#
#   Type: FileName
#
#   A string representing the absolute, platform-dependent path to a file.  Relative file paths are no longer in use anywhere in the
#   program.  All path manipulation should be done through <NaturalDocs::File>.
#
#
#   Type: VersionInt
#
#   A comparable integer representing a version number.  Converting them to and from text and binary should be handled by
#   <NaturalDocs::Version>.
#
#
#   Type: SymbolString
#
#   A scalar which encodes a normalized array of identifier strings representing a full or partially-resolved symbol.  All symbols
#   must be retrieved from plain text via <NaturalDocs::SymbolString->FromText()> so that the separation and normalization is
#   always consistent.  SymbolStrings are comparable via string compare functions and are sortable.
#
#
#   Type: ReferenceString
#
#   All the information about a reference that makes it unique encoded into a string.  This includes the <SymbolString> of the
#   reference, the scope <SymbolString> it appears in, the scope <SymbolStrings> it has access to via "using", and the
#   <ReferenceType>.  This is done because if any of those parameters change, it needs to be treated as a completely separate
#   reference.

# Group: Support Functions
# General functions that are used throughout the program, and that don't really fit anywhere else.


#
#   Function: StringCompare
#
#   Compares two strings so that the result is good for proper sorting.  A proper sort orders the characters as
#   follows:
#
#   - End of string.
#   - Whitespace.  Line break-tab-space.
#   - Symbols, which is anything not included in the other entries.
#   - Numbers, 0-9.
#   - Letters, case insensitive except to break ties.
#
#   If you use cmp instead of this function, the result would go by ASCII/Unicode values which would place certain symbols
#   between letters and numbers instead of having them all grouped together.  Also, you would have to choose between case
#   sensitivity or complete case insensitivity, in which ties are broken arbitrarily.
#
#   Returns:
#
#   Like cmp, it returns zero if A and B are equal, a positive value if A is greater than B, and a negative value if A is less than B.
#
sub StringCompare #(a, b)
    {
    my ($a, $b) = @_;

    if (!defined $a)
        {
        if (!defined $b)
            {  return 0;  }
        else
            {  return -1;  };
        }
    elsif (!defined $b)
        {
        return 1;
        };

    my $translatedA = lc($a);
    my $translatedB = lc($b);

    $translatedA =~ tr/\n\r\t 0-9a-z/\x01\x02\x03\x04\xDB-\xFE/;
    $translatedB =~ tr/\n\r\t 0-9a-z/\x01\x02\x03\x04\xDB-\xFE/;

    my $result = $translatedA cmp $translatedB;

    if ($result == 0)
        {
        # Break the tie by comparing their case.  Lowercase before uppercase.

        # If statement just to keep everything theoretically kosher, even though in practice we don't need this.
        if (ord('A') > ord('a'))
            {  return ($a cmp $b);  }
        else
            {  return ($b cmp $a);  };

        {  return $result;  };

#
#   Function: ShortenToMatchStrings
#
#   Compares two arrayrefs and shortens the first array to only contain shared entries.  Assumes all entries are strings.
#
#   Parameters:
#
#       sharedArrayRef - The arrayref that will be shortened to only contain common elements.
#       compareArrayRef - The arrayref to match.
#
sub ShortenToMatchStrings #(sharedArrayRef, compareArrayRef)

             $sharedArrayRef->[$index] eq $compareArrayRef->[$index])
        {  $index++;  };

#
#   Function: FindFirstSymbol
#
#   Searches a string for a number of symbols to see which appears first.
#
#   Parameters:
#
#       string - The string to search.
#       symbols - An arrayref of symbols to look for.
#       index - The index to start at, if any.
#
#   Returns:
#
#       The array ( index, symbol ).
#
#       index - The index the first symbol appears at, or -1 if none appear.
#       symbol - The symbol that appeared, or undef if none.
#
sub FindFirstSymbol #(string, symbols, index)
    {
    my ($string, $symbols, $index) = @_;
