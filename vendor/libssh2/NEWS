- Revert "aes: the init function fails when OpenSSL has AES support"
  
  This partially reverts commit f4f2298ef3635acd031cc2ee0e71026cdcda5864
  because it caused the compatibility code to call initialization routines
  redundantly, leading to memory leakage with OpenSSL 1.1 and broken curl
  test-suite in Fedora:
  
  88 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 5 of 8
     at 0x4C2DB8D: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:299)

  Basic dockerised test suite.
  
  This introduces a test suite for libssh2. It runs OpenSSH in a Docker
  container because that works well on Windows (via docker-machine) as
  well as Linux. Presumably it works on Mac too with docker-machine, but
  I've not tested that.
  
  Because the test suite is docker-machine aware, you can also run it
  against a cloud provider, for more realistic network testing, by setting
  your cloud provider as your active docker machine. The Appveyor CI setup
  in this commit does that because Appveyor doesn't support docker
  locally.

- Link with crypt32.lib on Windows.
  
  Makes linking with static OpenSSL work again.  Although it's not
  required for dynamic OpenSSL, it does no harm.
  
  Fixes #98.

- [Craig A. Berry brought this change]

  Tweak VMS help file building.
  
  Primarily this is handling cases where top-level files moved into
  the docs/ directory.  I also corrected a typo and removed the
  claim that libssh2 is public domain.

- [Craig A. Berry brought this change]

  Build with standard stat structure on VMS.
  
  This gets us large file support, is available on any VMS release
  in the last decade and more, and gives stat other modern features
  such as 64-bit ino_t.

- [Craig A. Berry brought this change]

  Update vms/libssh2_config.h.
  
  VMS does have stdlib.h, gettimeofday(), and OpenSSL.  The latter
  is appropriate to hard-wire in the configuration because it's
  installed by default as part of the base operating system and
  there is currently no libgcrypt port.

- [Craig A. Berry brought this change]

  VMS can't use %zd for off_t format.
  
  %z is a C99-ism that VMS doesn't currently have; even though the
  compiler is C99-compliant, the library isn't quite.  The off_t used
  for the st_size element of the stat can be 32-bit or 64-bit, so
  detect what we've got and pick a format accordingly.

- [Craig A. Berry brought this change]

  Normalize line endings in libssh2_sftp_get_channel.3.
  
  Somehow it got Windows-style CRLF endings so convert to just LF,
  for consistency as well as not to confuse tools that will regard
  the \r as content (e.g. the OpenVMS help librarian).

  sftp.c: Check Read Packet File Offset
  
  This commit adds a simple check to see if the offset of the read
  request matches the expected file offset.
  
  We could try to recover, from this condition at some point in the future.
  Right now it is better to return an error instead of corrupted data.

- [Jakob Egger brought this change]

  sftp.c: Don't return EAGAIN if data was written to buffer

- [Jakob Egger brought this change]

  sftp.c: Send at least one read request before reading
  
  This commit ensures that we have sent at least one read request before
  we try to read data in sftp_read().
  
  Otherwise sftp_read() would return 0 bytes (indicating EOF) if the
  socket is not ready for writing.

- [Jakob Egger brought this change]

  sftp.c: stop reading when buffer is full
  
  Since we can only store data from a single chunk in filep,
  we have to stop receiving data as soon as the buffer is full.
  
  This adresses the following bug report:
  https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/issues/50

Salvador Fandiño (21 Jan 2016)
- agent_disconnect_unix: unset the agent fd after closing it
  
  "agent_disconnect_unix", called by "libssh2_agent_disconnect", was
  leaving the file descriptor in the agent structure unchanged. Later,
  "libssh2_agent_free" would call again "libssh2_agent_disconnect" under
  the hood and it would try to close again the same file descriptor. In
  most cases that resulted in just a harmless error, but it is also
  possible that the file descriptor had been reused between the two
  calls resulting in the closing of an unrelated file descriptor.
  
  This patch sets agent->fd to LIBSSH2_INVALID_SOCKET avoiding that
  issue.

  os400qc3: support encrypted private keys
  
  PKCS#8 EncryptedPrivateKeyinfo structures are recognized and decoded to get
  values accepted by the Qc3 crypto library.

- [Patrick Monnerat brought this change]

  os400qc3: New PKCS#5 decoder
  
  The Qc3 library is not able to handle PKCS#8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo structures
  by itself. It is only capable of decrypting the (encrypted) PrivateKeyInfo
  part, providing a key encryption key and an encryption algorithm are given.
  Since the encryption key and algorithm description part in a PKCS#8
  EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo is a PKCS#5 structure, such a decoder is needed to
  get the derived key method and hash, as well as encryption algorith and
  initialisation vector.

- [Patrick Monnerat brought this change]

  os400qc3: force continuous update on non-final hash/hmac computation

- [Patrick Monnerat brought this change]

  os400qc3: Be sure hmac keys have a minimum length
  
  The Qc3 library requires a minimum key length depending on the target
  hash algorithm. Append binary zeroes to the given key if not long enough.
  This matches RFC 2104 specifications.

- [Patrick Monnerat brought this change]

  os400qc3: Slave descriptor for key encryption key
  
  The Qc3 library requires the key encryption key to exist as long as
  the encrypted key is used. Its descriptor token is then kept as an
  "encrypted key slave" for recursive release.

  os400: implement character encoding conversion support

  os400: do not miss some external prototypes
  
  Build procedure extproto() did not strip braces from header files, thus
  possibly prepended them to true prototypes. This prevented the prototype to
  be recognized as such.
  The solution implemented here is to map braces to semicolons, effectively
  considering them as potential prototype delimiters.

- [Patrick Monnerat brought this change]

  Protect callback function calls from macro substitution
  
  Some structure fields holding callback addresses have the same name as the
  underlying system function (connect, send, recv). Set parentheses around
  their reference to suppress a possible macro substitution.
  
  Use a macro for connect() on OS/400 to resolve a const/nonconst parameter

  Feature an optional crypto-specific macro to rsa sign a data fragment vector
  
  OS/400 crypto library is unable to sign a precomputed SHA1 hash: however
  it does support a procedure that hashes data fragments and rsa signs.
  If defined, the new macro _libssh2_rsa_sha1_signv() implements this function
  and disables use of _libssh2_rsa_sha1_sign().
  
  The function described above requires that the struct iovec unused slacks are
  cleared: for this reason, macro libssh2_prepare_iovec() has been introduced.
  It should be defined as empty for crypto backends that are not sensitive
  to struct iovec unused slack values.

- wincng.c: fixed _libssh2_wincng_hash_final return value
  
  _libssh2_wincng_hash_final was returning the internal BCRYPT
  status code instead of a valid libssh2 return value (0 or -1).
  
  This also means that _libssh2_wincng_hash never returned 0.

- wincng.c: fixed possible memory leak in _libssh2_wincng_hash
  
  If _libssh2_wincng_hash_update failed _libssh2_wincng_hash_final
  would never have been called before.

- [Salvador Fandino brought this change]

  libssh2_session_set_last_error: Add function
  
  Net::SSH2, the Perl wrapping module for libssh2 implements several features*
  on top of libssh2 that can fail and so need some mechanism to report the error
  condition to the user.
  
  Until now, besides the error state maintained internally by libssh2, another
  error state was maintained at the Perl level for every session object and then
  additional logic was used to merge both error states. That is a maintenance
  nighmare, and actually there is no way to do it correctly and consistently.
  
  In order to allow the high level language to add new features to the library
  but still rely in its error reporting features the new function
  libssh2_session_set_last_error (that just exposses _libssh2_error_flags) is
  introduced.
  
  *) For instance, connecting to a remote SSH service giving the hostname and
  port.

  _libssh2_error: Support allocating the error message

  This patch adds a new function "_libssh2_error_flags" accepting an
  additional "flags" argument and specifically the flag
  "LIBSSH2_ERR_FLAG_DUP" indicating that the passed string must be

  Then, the method "_libssh2_error" has been rewritten to use that new
  function under the hood.

  userauth: Fix off by one error when reading public key file
  
  After reading the public key from file the size was incorrectly
  decremented by one.
  
  This was usually a harmless error as the last character on the public
  key file is an unimportant EOL. But if due to some error the public key
  file is empty, the public key size becomes (uint)(0 - 1), resulting in
  an unrecoverable out of memory error later.

- Let CMake build work as a subproject.
  
  Patch contributed by JasonHaslam.

- Fix builds with Visual Studio 2015.
  
  VS2015 moved stdio functions to the header files as inline function.  That means check_function_exists can't detect them because it doesn't use header files - just does a link check.  Instead we need to use check_symbol_exists with the correct headers.

- cmake: include CMake files in the release tarballs
  
  Despite we announced the CMake support in libssh2-1.6.0 release notes,

  upstream git repository.

  SFTP: Increase speed and datasize in SFTP read
  
  The function sftp_read never return more then 2000 bytes (as it should
  when I asked Daniel). I increased the MAX_SFTP_READ_SIZE to 30000 but
  didn't get the same speed as a sftp read in SecureSSH. I analyzed the
  code and found that a return always was dona when a chunk has been read.
  I changed it to a sliding buffer and worked on all available chunks. I
  got an increase in speed and non of the test I have done has failed
  (both local net and over Internet). Please review and test. I think
  30000 is still not the optimal MAX_SFTP_READ_SIZE, my next goal is to
  make an API to enable changing this value (The SecureSSH sftp_read has
  more complete filled packages when comparing the network traffic)

  Initialise HMAC_CTX in more places.
  
  Missed a couple more places we init ctx to avoid openssl threading crash.

- Build build breakage in WinCNG backend caused when adding libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory.
  
  The new feature isn't implemented for the WinCNG backend currently, but the WinCNG backend didn't contain any implementation of the required backend functions - even ones that returns an error.  That caused link errors.
  
  This change fixes the problem by providing an implementation of the backend functions that returns an error.

- Fix breakage in WinCNG backend caused by introducing libssh2_hmac_ctx_init.
  
  The macro was defined to nothing for the libgcrypt backend, but not for WinCNG.  This brings the latter into line with the former.

- Prevent collisions between CMake and Autotools in examples/ and tests/.

- Avoid clash between CMake build and Autotools.
  
  Autotools expects a configuration template file at src/libssh2_config.h.in, which buildconf generates.  But the CMake build system has its CMake-specific version of the file at this path.  This means that, if you don't run buildconf, the Autotools build will fail because it configured the wrong header template.

  windows build: do not export externals from static library
  
  If you are building a DLL, then you need to explicitly export each

- Fix non-autotools builds: Always define the LIBSSH2_OPENSSL CPP macro
  
  Commit d512b25f69a1b6778881f6b4b5ff9cfc6023be42 introduced a crypto
  library abstraction in the autotools build system, to allow us to more
  easily support new crypto libraries. In that process it was found that
  all other build system which we support are hard-coded to build with
  OpenSSL. Commit f5c1a0d98bd51aeb24aca3d49c7c81dcf8bd858d fixes automake
  introduced into non-autotools build systems but still overlooked the
  CPP macro saying that we are using OpenSSL.
  
  Thanks to Marc Hörsken for identifying this issue and proposing a fix
  for win32/{GNUmakefile,config.mk}. This commit uses a slightly different
  approach but the end result is the same.

- knownhost: Restore behaviour of `libssh2_knownhost_writeline` with short buffer.
  
  Commit 85c6627c changed the behaviour of `libssh2_knownhost_writeline` so that it stopped returning the number of bytes needed when the given buffer was too small.  Also, the function changed such that is might write to part of the buffer before realising it is too small.
  
  This commit restores the original behaviour, whilst keeping the unknown-key-type functionality that 85c6627c.  Instead of writing to the buffer piecemeal, the length of the various parts is calculated up front and the buffer written only if there is enough space.  The calculated necessary size is output in `outlen` regardless of whether the buffer was written to.
  
  The main use-case for the original behaviour that this commit restores is to allow passing in a NULL buffer to get the actual buffer size needed, before calling the function again with the buffer allocated to the exact size required.

- userauth: Fixed an attempt to free from stack on error

- Fixed a few memory leaks in error paths

- Fixed two potential use-after-frees of the payload buffer
  
  The first might occur if _libssh2_packet_add returns an error, as
  fullpacket_state wasn't reset to idle so if it were possible for
  fullpacket to be called again, it would return to the same state
  handler and re-use the freed p->packet buffer.
  
  The second could occur if decrypt returned an error, as it freed the
  packet buffer but did not clear total_num, meaning that freed buffer
  could be written into again later.

- Fix missing `_libssh2_error` in `_libssh2_channel_write`.
  
  In one case, the error code from `_libssh2_transport_read` was being returned from `_libssh2_channel_write` without setting it as the last error by calling `_libssh2_error`.  This commit fixes that.
  
  Found when using a session whose socket had been inadvertently destroyed.  The calling code got confused because via `libssh2_session_last_error` it appeared no error had occurred, despite one being returned from the previous function.

- Move automake conditionals added by commit d512b25f out of Makefile.inc
  
  Commit d512b25f69a1b6778881f6b4b5ff9cfc6023be42 added automake
  conditionals to Makefile.inc but since Makefile.inc is included
  from Makefile for all other build systems that does not work.
  
  This commit instead adds Makefile.OpenSSL.inc and Makefile.libgcrypt.inc
  and moves the automake conditional to its proper place, src/Makefile.am.
  
  The automake conditional includes the correct Makefile.$name.inc per
  the crypto library selection/detection done by configure.
  
  All non-autotools build system files in libssh2 are hardcoded to use
  OpenSSL and do not get a conditional but at least there is some reuse
  because they can all include the new Makefile.OpenSSL.inc.

  round-trip delays can easily reach 300ms.
  
  The issue was not visible because the configured channel window size
  was being ignored and a hard-coded value of ~22MB being used instead,
  but that was fixed on a previous commit.
  
  This patch just changes the default window size
  (LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_WINDOW_DEFAULT) to 2MB. It is the same value used by
  OpenSSH and in our opinion represents a good compromise between memory
  used and transfer speed.
  
  Performance tests were run to determine the optimum value. The details
  and related discussion are available from the following thread on the
  libssh2 mailing-list:
  
  http://www.libssh2.org/mail/libssh2-devel-archive-2013-10/0018.shtml
  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.network.ssh.libssh2.devel/6543
  
  An excerpt follows:
  
  "I have been running some transfer test and measuring their speed.
  
  My setup was composed of a quad-core Linux machine running Ubuntu 13.10
  x86_64 with a LXC container inside. The data transfers were performed
  from the container to the host (never crossing through a physical
  network device).
  
  Network delays were simulated using the tc tool. And ping was used to
  verify that they worked as intended during the tests.
  
  The operation performed was the equivalent to the following ssh command:
  
    $ ssh container "dd bs=16K count=8K if=/dev/zero" >/dev/null
  
  Though, establishment and closing of the SSH connection was excluded
  from the timings.
  
  I run the tests several times transferring files of sizes up to 128MB
  and the results were consistent between runs.
  
  The results corresponding to the 128MB transfer are available here:
  
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao1yRmX6PQQzdG5wSFlrZl9HRWNET3ZyN0hnaGo5ZFE&usp=sharing
  
  It clearly shows that 256KB is too small as the default window size.
  Moving to a 512MB generates a great improvement and after the 1MB mark
  the returns rapidly diminish. Other factors (TCP window size, probably)
  become more limiting than the channel window size
  
  For comparison I also performed the same transfers using OpenSSH. Its
  speed is usually on par with that of libssh2 using a window size of 1MB
  (even if it uses a 2MB window, maybe it is less aggressive sending the
  window adjust msgs)."

  _libssh2_channel_read: Honour window_size_initial
  
  _libssh2_channel_read was using an arbitrary hard-coded limit to trigger
  the window adjusting code. The adjustment used was also hard-coded and
  arbitrary, 15MB actually, which would limit the usability of libssh2 on
  systems with little RAM.
  
  This patch, uses the window_size parameter passed to
  libssh2_channel_open_ex (stored as remote.window_size_initial) plus the
  buflen as the base for the trigger and the adjustment calculation.
  
  The memory usage when using the default window size is reduced from 22MB
  to 256KB per channel (actually, if compression is used, these numbers
  should be incremented by ~50% to account for the errors between the
  decompressed packet sizes and the predicted sizes).
  
  My tests indicate that this change does not impact the performance of
  transfers across localhost or a LAN, being it on par with that of
  OpenSSH. On the other hand, it will probably slow down transfers on
  networks with high bandwidth*delay when the default window size
  (LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_WINDOW_DEFAULT=256KB) is used.

  knownhosts: handle unknown key types
  
  Store but don't use keys of unsupported types on the known_hosts file.
  
  Currently, when libssh2 parses a known_host file containing keys of some
  type it doesn't natively support, it stops reading the file and returns
  an error.
  
  That means, that the known_host file can not be safely shared with other
  software supporting other key types (i.e. OpenSSH).
  
  This patch adds support for handling keys of unknown type. It can read
  and write them, even if they are never going to be matched.
  
  At the source level the patch does the following things:
  
  - add a new unknown key type LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEY_UNKNOWN
  
  - add a new slot (key_type_name) on the known_host struct that is
  used to store the key type in ascii form when it is not supported
  
  - parse correctly known_hosts entries with unknown key types and
  populate the key_type_name slot
  
  - print correctly known_hosts entries of unknown type
  
  - when checking a host key ignore keys that do not match the key

  Fix zlib deflate usage
  
  Deflate may return Z_OK even when not all data has been compressed
  if the output buffer becomes full.
  
  In practice this is very unlikely to happen because the output buffer
  size is always some KBs larger than the size of the data passed for
  compression from the upper layers and I think that zlib never expands
  the data so much, even on the worst cases.
  
  Anyway, this patch plays on the safe side checking that the output
  buffer is not exhausted.

  comp_method_zlib_decomp: Improve buffer growing algorithm
  
  The old algorithm was O(N^2), causing lots and lots of reallocations
  when highly compressed data was transferred.
  
  This patch implements a simpler one that just doubles the buffer size
  everytime it is exhausted. It results in O(N) complexity.
  
  Also a smaller inflate ratio is used to calculate the initial size (x4).

  Fix zlib usage
  
  Data may remain in zlib internal buffers when inflate() returns Z_OK
  and avail_out == 0. In that case, inflate has to be called again.
  
  Also, once all the data has been inflated, it returns Z_BUF_ERROR to
  signal that the input buffer has been exhausted.
  
  Until now, the way to detect that a packet payload had been completely
  decompressed was to check that no data remained on the input buffer
  but that didn't account for the case where data remained on the internal
  zlib buffers.
  
  That resulted in packets not being completely decompressed and the
  missing data reappearing on the next packet, though the bug was masked
  by the buffer allocation algorithm most of the time and only manifested
  when transferring highly compressible data.
  
  This patch fixes the zlib usage.

  _libssh2_channel_read: fix data drop when out of window
  
  After filling the read buffer with data from the read queue, when the
  window size was too small, "libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust" was
  called to increase it. In non-blocking mode that function could return
  EAGAIN and, in that case, the EAGAIN was propagated upwards and the data
  already read on the buffer lost.
  
  The function was also moving between the two read states
  "libssh2_NB_state_idle" and "libssh2_NB_state_created" both of which
  behave in the same way (excepting a debug statment).
  
  This commit modifies "_libssh2_channel_read" so that the
  "libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust" call is performed first (when
  required) and if everything goes well, then it reads the data from the
  queued packets into the read buffer.
  
  It also removes the useless "libssh2_NB_state_created" read state.
  
  Some rotted comments have also been updated.

  window_size: redid window handling for flow control reasons
  
  Until now, the window size (channel->remote.window_size) was being
  updated just after receiving the packet from the transport layer.
  
  That behaviour is wrong because the channel queue may grow uncontrolled
  when data arrives from the network faster that the upper layer consumes
  it.
  
  This patch adds a new counter, read_avail, which keeps a count of the
  bytes available from the packet queue for reading. Also, now the window
  size is adjusted when the data is actually read by an upper layer.
  
  That way, if the upper layer stops reading data, the window will
  eventually fill and the remote host will stop sending data. When the
  upper layers reads enough data, a window adjust packet is delivered and
  the transfer resumes.
  
  The read_avail counter is used to detect the situation when the remote
  server tries to send data surpassing the window size. In that case, the
  extra data is discarded.

- comp_method_zlib_decomp: handle Z_BUF_ERROR when inflating
  
  When using libssh2 to perform an SFTP file transfer from the "JSCAPE MFT
  Server" (http://www.jscape.com) the transfer failed. The default JSCAPE
  configuration is to enforce zlib compression on SSH2 sessions so the
  session was compressed. The relevant part of the debug trace contained:
  
   [libssh2] 1.052750 Transport: unhandled zlib error -5
   [libssh2] 1.052750 Failure Event: -29 - decompression failure
  
  The trace comes from comp_method_zlib_decomp() in comp.c. The "unhandled
  zlib error -5" is the status returned from the zlib function
  inflate(). The -5 status corresponds to "Z_BUF_ERROR".
  
  The inflate() function takes a pointer to a z_stream structure and
  "inflates" (decompresses) as much as it can. The relevant fields of the
  z_stream structure are:
  
    next_in - pointer to the input buffer containing compressed data
    avail_in - the number of bytes available at next_in
    next_out - pointer to the output buffer to be filled with uncompressed
               data
    avail_out - how much space available at next_out
  
  To decompress data you set up a z_stream struct with the relevant fields
  filled in and pass it to inflate(). On return the fields will have been
  updated so next_in and avail_in show how much compressed data is yet to
  be processed and next_out and avail_out show how much space is left in
  the output buffer.
  
  If the supplied output buffer is too small then on return there will be
  compressed data yet to be processed (avail_in != 0) and inflate() will
  return Z_OK. In this case the output buffer must be grown, avail_out
  updated and inflate() called again.
  
  If the supplied output buffer was big enough then on return the
  compressed data will have been exhausted (avail_in == 0) and inflate()
  will return Z_OK, so the data has all been uncompressed.
  
  There is a corner case where inflate() makes no progress. That is, there
  may be unprocessed compressed data and space available in the output
  buffer and yet the function does nothing. In this case inflate() will
  return Z_BUF_ERROR. From the zlib documentation and the source code it
  is not clear under what circumstances this happens. It could be that it
  needs to write multiple bytes (all in one go) from its internal state to
  the output buffer before processing the next chunk of input but but
  can't because there is not enough space (though my guesses as to the
  cause are not really relevant). Recovery from Z_BUF_ERROR is pretty
  simple - just grow the output buffer, update avail_out and call
  inflate() again.
  
  The comp_method_zlib_decomp() function does not handle the case when
  inflate() returns Z_BUF_ERROR. It treats it as a non-recoverable error
  and basically aborts the session.

- Prevent sftp_packet_read accessing freed memory.
  
  sftp_packet_add takes ownership of the packet passed to it and (now that we
  handle zombies) might free the packet.  sftp_packet_read uses the packet type
  byte as its return code but by this point sftp_packet_add might have freed
  it.  This change fixes the problem by caching the packet type before calling
  sftp_packet_add.
  
  I don't understand why sftp_packet_read uses the packet type as its return
  code.  A future change might get rid of this entirely.

Daniel Stenberg (12 May 2012)
- sftp_packet_flush: flush zombies too
  
  As this function is called when the SFTP session is closed, it needs to
  also kill all zombies left in the SFTP session to avoid leaking memory
  just in case some zombie would still be in there.

- sftp_packetlist_flush: zombies must not have responses already
  
  When flushing the packetlist, we must only add the request as a zombie
  if no response has already been received. Otherwise we could wrongly
  make it a zombie even though the response was already received and then
  we'd get a zombie stuck there "forever"...

- sftp_read: on EOF remove packet before flush
  
  Since the sftp_packetlist_flush() function will move all the existing
  FXP_READ requests in this handle to the zombie list we must first remove
  this just received packet as it is clearly not a zombie.

- sftp_packet_require: sftp_packet_read() returning 0 is not an error
  
  Exactly as the comment in the code said, checking the return code from
  sftp_packet_read() with <= was wrong and it should be < 0. With the new
  filtering on incoming packets that are "zombies" we can now see this
  getting zero returned.

- sftp_packetlist_flush: only make it zombie if it was sent
  
  The list of outgoing packets may also contain packets that never were
  sent off and we better not make them zombies too.

- [Alexander Lamaison brought this change]

  Mark outstanding read requests after EOF as zombies.
  
  In order to be fast, sftp_read sends many read requests at once.  With a small
  file, this can mean that when EOF is received back, many of these requests are
  still outstanding.  Responses arriving after we close the file and abandon the
  file handle are queued in the SFTP packet queue and never collected.  This
  causes transfer speed to drop as a progressively longer queue must be searched
  for every packet.
  
  This change introduces a zombie request-ID list in the SFTP session that is
  used to recognise these outstanding requests and prevent them being added to
  the queue.

- userauth.c: fread() from public key file to correctly detect any errors
  
  If the filename parameter for file_read_publickey() was the name of a
  directory instead of a file then libssh2 would spin trying to fgetc()
  from the FILE * for the opened directory when trying to determine the
  length of the encoded public key, since fgetc() can't report errors.
  
  Use fread() instead to correctly detect this error condition along
  with many others.

Daniel Stenberg (4 Apr 2012)
- RELEASE-NOTES: updated for 1.4.1 release

- always do "forced" window updates
  
  When calling _libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust() internally, we now
  always use the 'force' option to prevent libssh2 to avoid sending the
  update if the update isn't big enough.
  
  It isn't fully analyzed but we have seen corner cases which made a
  necessary window update not get send due to this and then the other side
  doesn't send data our side then sits waiting for forever.

- channel_read: force window adjusts!
  
  if there's not enough room to receive the data that's being requested,
  the window adjustment needs to be sent to the remote and thus the force
  option has to be used. _libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust() would
  otherwise "queue" small window adjustments for a later packet but that
  is really terribly for the small buffer read that for example is the
  final little piece of a very large file as then there is no logical next
  packet!

  transport_send: Finish in-progress key exchange before sending data
  
  _libssh2_channel_write() first reads outstanding packets before writing
  new data. If it reads a key exchange request, it will immediately start
  key re-exchange, which will require sending a response. If the output
  socket is full, this will result in a return from
  _libssh2_transport_read() of LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN. In order not to block
  a write because there is no data to read, this error is explicitly
  ignored and the code continues marshalling a packet for sending. When it
  is sent, the remote end immediately drops the connection because it was
  expecting a continuation of the key exchange, but got a data packet.
  
  This change adds the same check for key exchange to
  _libssh2_transport_send() that is in _libssh2_transport_read(). This
  ensures that key exchange is completed before any data packet is sent.

- channel_write: acknowledge transport errors
  
  When draining data off the socket with _libssh2_transport_read() (which
  in turn has to be done so that we can be sure to have read any possible
  window-increasing packets), this code previously ignored errors which
  could lead to nasty loops. Now all error codes except EAGAIN will cause
  the error to be returned at once.

- sftp_packet_add: use named error code instead of number

- SFTP: preserve the original error code more
  
  Lots of places in the code translated the original error into the more
  generic LIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_TIMEOUT but this turns out to distort the
  original error reason a lot and makes tracking down the real origin of a
  problem really hard. This change makes the original error code be
  preserved to a larger extent when return up to the parent function.

- sftp_packet_read: adjust window size as necessary
  
  Commit 03ca9020756 tried to simplify the window sizing logic but broke

  This change introduces window sizing logic to the sftp_packet_read()
  function so that it now tells the remote about the local size having a
  window size that suffice when it is about to ask for directory data.

  libssh2_sftp_seek64: flush packetlist and buffered data
  
  When seeking to a new position, flush the packetlist and buffered data
  to prevent already received or pending data to wrongly get used when
  sftp-reading from the new offset within the file.

- sftp_read: advance offset correctly for buffered copies
  
  In the case where a read packet has been received from the server, but
  the entire contents couldn't be copied to the user-buffer, the data is
  instead buffered and copied to the user's buffer in the next invocation
  of sftp_read(). When that "extra" copy is made, the 'offset' pointer was
  not advanced accordingly.
  
  The biggest impact of this flaw was that the 'already' variable at the
  top of the function that figures out how much data "ahead" that has
  already been asked for would slowly go more and more out of sync, which
  could lead to the file not being read all the way to the end.
  
  This problem was most noticable in cases where the application would
  only try to read the exact file size amount, like curl does. In the
  examples libssh2 provides the sftp read function is most often called
  with a fixed size large buffer and then the bug would not appear as
  easily.
  
  This bug was introduced in the SFTP rewrite in 1.2.8.

  much and ended up overflowing a buffer within the LIBSSH2_SESSION
  struct. Back to allocating the buffer properly like it used to do.

  _libssh2_recv(): handle ENOENT error as EAGAIN
  
  A sftp session failed with error "failure establishing ssh session" on
  Solaris and HP-UX. Sometimes the first recv() function call sets errno
  to ENOENT. In the man pages for recv of Solaris and HP-UX the error
  ENOENT is not documented.
  
  I tested Solaris SPARC and x86, HP-UX i64, AIX, Windows and Linux.

- sftp_read: avoid wrapping counter to insanity
  
  As pointed out in bug #206, if a second invoke of libssh2_sftp_read()

  "negative" by some wrong math, and that value would be the amount of

- ssh2_echo: Value stored to 'exitcode' is never read

- _libssh2_packet_add: fix SSH_MSG_DEBUG weirdness
  
  I believe I may have caused this weird typo style error when I cleaned
  up this function a while ago. Corrected now.

- uint32: more longs converted to proper types
  
  I also moved the MAC struct over to the mac.h header file and made sure
  that the users of that struct include that file.

- SFTP: more types to uint32_t
  
  The 'num_names' field in the SSH_FXP_NAME response is an unsigned 32bit
  value so we make sure to treat it like that.

- SFTP: request_ids are uint32_t
  
  I went over the code and made sure we use uint32_t all over for the
  request_id data. It is an unsigned 32bit value on the wire.

- SFTP: store request_id separately in packets
  
  By using a new separate struct for incoming SFTP packets and not sharing
  the generic packet struct, we can get rid of an unused field and add a
  new one dedicated for holding the request_id for the incoming
  package. As sftp_packet_ask() is called fairly often, a "mere" integer
  comparison is MUCH faster than the previous memcmp() of (typically) 5
  bytes.

- libssh2_sftp_open_ex: man page extended and cleaned up
  
  I added the missing documentation for the 'flags' argument.

- SFTP: unify the READ/WRITE chunk structs

- SFTP: fix memory leaks
  
  Make sure that we cleanup remainders when the handle is closed and when
  the subsystem is shutdown.
  
  Existing flaw: if a single handle sends packets that haven't been
  replied to yet at the time when the handle is closed, those packets will
  arrive later and end up in the generic packet brigade queue and they
  will remain in there until flushed. They will use unnecessary memory,
  make things slower and they will ruin the SFTP handling if the
  request_id counter ever wraps (highly unlikely to every happen).

- sftp_close_handle: packet list is generic
  
  Fix comment, simplify the loop logic

- sftp_read: pipeline reads
  
  The SFTP read function now does transfers the same way the SFTP write
  function was made to recently: it creates a list of many outgoing
  FXP_READ packets that each asks for a small data chunk. The code then
  tries to keep sending read request while collecting the acks for the
  previous requests and returns the received data.

- sftp_write: removed unused variable

- _libssh2_channel_close: don't call transport read if disconnected
  
  The loop that waits for remote.close to get set may end up looping
  forever since session->socket_state gets set to
  LIBSSH2_SOCKET_DISCONNECTED by the packet_add() function called from the
  transport_read() function and after having been set to
  LIBSSH2_SOCKET_DISCONNECTED, the transport_read() function will only
  return 0.

- libssh2_sftp_seek64: new man page
  
  Split off libssh2_sftp_seek64 from the libssh2_sftp_seek man page, and
  mentioned that we consider the latter deprecated. Also added a mention
  about the dangers of doing seek during writing or reading.

- sftp_seek: fix
  
  The new SFTP write code caused a regression as the seek function no
  longer worked as it didn't set the write position properly.
  
  It should be noted that seeking is STRONGLY PROHIBITED during upload, as
  the upload magic uses two different offset positions and the multiple
  outstanding packets etc make them sensitive to change in the midst of
  operations.
  
  This functionality was just verified with the new example code
  sftp_append. This bug was filed as bug #202:
  
  Bug: http://trac.libssh2.org/ticket/202

- sftp_append: new example doing SFTP append

- MAX_SFTP_OUTGOING_SIZE: 30000
  
  I ran SFTP upload tests against localhost. It showed that to make the
  app reach really good speeds, I needed to do a little code tweak and
  change MAX_SFTP_OUTGOING_SIZE from 4000 to 30000. The tests I did before
  with the high latency tests didn't show any real difference whatever I
  had that size set to.
  
  This number is the size in bytes that libssh2 cuts off the large input
  buffer and sends off as an individual sftp packet.

- sftp_write_sliding.c: new example
  
  This is an example that is very similar to sftp_write_nonblock.c, with
  the exception that this uses
  
  1 - a larger upload buffer
  
  2 - a sliding buffer mechnism to allow the app to keep sending lots of
  data to libssh2 without having to first drain the buffer.
  
  These are two key issues to make libssh2 SFTP uploads really perform
  well at this point in time.

- cpp: s/#elsif/#elif
  
  This looks like a typo as #elsif is not really C...

- _libssh2_channel_write: revert channel_write() use
  
  The attempts made to have _libssh2_channel_write() accept larger pieces
  of data and split up the data by itself into 32700 byte chunks and pass
  them on to channel_write() in a loop as a way to do faster operations on
  larger data blocks was a failed attempt.
  
  The reason why it is difficult:
  
  The API only allows EAGAIN or a length to be returned. When looping over
  multiple blocks to get sent, one block can get sent and the next might
  not. And yet: when transport_send() has returned EAGAIN we must not call
  it again with new data until it has returned OK on the existing data it
  is still working on. This makes it a mess and we do get a much easier
  job by simply returning the bytes or EAGAIN at once, as in the EAGAIN
  case we can assume that we will be called with the same arguments again
  and transport_send() will be happy.
  
  Unfortunately, I think we take a small performance hit by not being able
  to do this.

- ssh2_echo: new example
  
  This is a new example snippet. The code is largely based on ssh2_exec,
  and is written by Tommy Lindgren. I edited it into C90 compliance and to
  conform to libssh2 indent style and some more.

- send_existing: return after send_existing
  
  When a piece of data is sent from the send_existing() function we must
  make the parent function return afterwards. Otherwise we risk that the
  parent function tries to send more data and ends up getting an EGAIN for
  that more data and since it can only return one return code it doesn't
  return info for the successfully sent data.
  
  As this change is a regression I now added a larger comment explaining
  why it has to work like this.

- _libssh2_channel_write: count resent data as written
  
  In the logic that resends data that was kept for that purpose due to a
  previous EAGAIN, the data was not counted as sent causing badness.

- Use fprintf(stderr, ) instead of write(2, ) for debugging

- session/transport: Correctly handle when _libssh2_send() returns -EAGAIN

- src/agent.c: Simplify _libssh2_send() error checking ever so slightly

Daniel Stenberg (12 Nov 2010)
- send/recv: use _libssh2_recv and _libssh2_send now
  
  Starting now, we unconditionally use the internal replacement functions
  for send() and recv() - creatively named _libssh2_recv() and
  _libssh2_send().
  
  On errors, these functions return the negative 'errno' value instead of
  the traditional -1. This design allows systems that have no "natural"
  errno support to not have to invent it. It also means that no code
  outside of these two transfer functions should use the errno variable.

- channel_write: move some logic to _libssh2_channel_write
  
  Some checks are better done in _libssh2_channel_write just once per
  write instead of in channel_write() since the looping will call the
  latter function multiple times per _libssh2_channel_write() invoke.

- sftp_write: handle "left over" acked data
  
  The SFTP handle struct now buffers number of acked bytes that haven't
  yet been returned. The way this is used is as following:
  
  1. sftp_write() gets called with a buffer of let say size 32000. We
  split 32000 into 8 smaller packets and send them off one by one. One of
  them gets acked before the function returns so 4000 is returned.
  
  2. sftp_write() gets called again a short while after the previous one,
  now with a much smaller size passed in to the function. Lets say 8000.
  In the mean-time, all of the remaining packets from the previous call
  have been acked (7*4000 = 28000). This function then returns 8000 as all
  data passed in are already sent and it can't return any more than what
  it got passed in. But we have 28000 bytes acked. We now store the
  remaining 20000 in the handle->u.file.acked struct field to add up in
  the next call.
  
  3. sftp_write() gets called again, and now there's a backlogged 20000
  bytes to return as fine and that will get skipped from the beginning
  of the buffer that is passed in.

- sftp_write: polished and simplified
  
  Removed unnecessary struct fields and state changes within the function.
  
  Made the loop that checks for ACKs only check chunks that were fully
  sent.

- SCP: on failure, show the numerical error reason
  
  By calling libssh2_session_last_errno()

- SFTP: provide the numerical error reason on failure

- SCP: clean up failure treatment
  
  When SCP send or recv fails, it gets a special message from the server
  with a warning or error message included. We have no current API to
  expose that message but the foundation is there. Removed unnecessary use
  of session struct fields.

- sftp_write: enlarge buffer to perform better

- packets: code cleanup
  
  I added size checks in several places. I fixed the code flow to be easier
  to read in some places.
  
  I removed unnecessary zeroing of structs. I removed unused struct fields.

- LIBSSH2_CALLBACK_MACERROR: clarify return code use

- _libssh2_userauth_publickey: avoid shadowing

- packet: avoid shadowing global symbols

- sftp_readdir: avoid shadowing

- shadowing: don't shadow the global compress

- _libssh2_packet_add: check SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST packet

- _libssh2_packet_add: SSH_MSG_DEBUG length checks
  
  Verify lengths before using them. Read always_display from the correct
  index. Don't copy stuff around just to provide zero-termination of the
  strings.

- _libssh2_packet_add: SSH_MSG_IGNORE skip memmove
  
  There's no promise of a zero termination of the data in the callback so
  no longer perform ugly operation in order to provide it.

- _libssh2_packet_add: SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT length checks
  
  Verify lengths before trying to read data.

- indent: break lines at 80 columns

- SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_FAILURE: used defined values
  
  We don't like magic numbers in the code. Now the acceptable failure
  codes sent in the SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_FAILURE message are added as
  defined values in the private header file.

- sftp_write: don't return EAGAIN if no EAGAIN was received
  
  This function now only returns EAGAIN if a lower layer actually returned
  EAGAIN to it. If nothing was acked and no EAGAIN was received, it will
  now instead return 0.

- _libssh2_wait_socket: detect nothing-to-wait-for
  
  If _libssh2_wait_socket() gets called but there's no direction set to
  wait for, this causes a "hang". This code now detects this situation,
  set a 1 second timeout instead and outputs a debug output about it.

- decomp: remove the free_dest argument
  
  Since the decompress function ALWAYS returns allocated memory we get a
  lot simpler code by removing the ability to return data unallocated.

- decomp: cleaned off old compression stuff
  
  I cleared off legacy code from when the compression and decompression
  functions were a single unified function. Makes the code easier to read
  too.

  kex_agree_hostkey: fix NULL pointer derefence
  
  While setting up the session, ssh tries to determine the type of
  encryption method it can use for the session. This requires looking at
  the keys offered by the remote host and comparing these with the methods
  supported by libssh2 (rsa & dss). To do this there is an iteration over
  the array containing the methods supported by libssh2.
  
  If there is no agreement on the type of encryption we come to the 3rd
  entry of the hostkeyp array. Here hostkeyp is valid but *hostkep is
  NULL. Thus when we dereference that in (*hostkeyp)->name there is a
  crash

- _libssh2_transport_send: remove dead assignment
  
  'data' isn't accessed beyond this point so there's no need to assign it.

- scp_recv: remove dead assignment
  
  Instead of assigning a variable we won't read, we now use the more
  explicit (void) prefix.

- sftp_write: removed superfluous assignment

- bugfix: avoid use of uninitialized value

- sftp_packet_require: propagate error codes better
  
  There were some chances that they would cause -1 to get returned by
  public functions and as we're hunting down all such occurances and since
  the underlying functions do return valuable information the code now
  passes back proper return codes better.

  fix memory leaks (two times cipher_data) for each sftp session

- libssh2_userauth_authenticated: make it work as documented
  
  The man page clearly says it returns 1 for "already authenticated" but
  the code said non-zero. I changed the code to use 1 now, as that is also
  non-zero but it gets the benefit that it now matches the documentation.
  
  Using 1 instead of non-zero is better for two reasons:
  
  1. We have the opportunity to introduce other return codes in the future for
     things like error and what not.
  2. We don't expose the internal bitmask variable value.

- userauth_keyboard_interactive: fix indent

- [Alfred Gebert brought this change]

  fix memory leak in userauth_keyboard_interactive()
  
  First I wanted to free the memory in session_free() but then

  twice perhaps because the server has this authentication
  methods available: publickey,gssapi-with-mic,keyboard-interactive
  The keyboard-interactive method is successful.

  simplified the function and removed some unused struct fields

- _libssh2_transport_send: replaces _libssh2_transport_write
  
  The new function takes two data areas, combines them and sends them as a
  single SSH packet. This allows several functions to allocate and copy
  less data.
  
  I also found and fixed a mixed up use of the compression function
  arguments that I introduced in my rewrite in a recent commit.

- scp_write_nonblock: use select() instead of busyloop
  
  Make this example nicer by not busylooping.

- send_existing: clear olen when the data is sent off

- _libssh2_transport_write: allow 256 extra bytes around the packet

- _libssh2_transport_write: remade to send without malloc

- compress: compression disabled by default
  
  We now allow libssh2_session_flag() to enable compression with a new
  flag and I added documentation for the previous LIBSSH2_FLAG_SIGPIPE
  flag which I wasn't really aware of!

- comp: split the compress function
  
  It is now made into two separate compress and decompress functions. In
  preparation for upcoming further modficications.

Daniel Stenberg (11 Oct 2010)
- scp_recv: improved treatment of channel_read() returning zero
  
  As a zero return code from channel_read() is not an error we must make
  sure that the SCP functions deal with that properly. channel_read()
  always returns 0 if the channel is EOFed already so we check for EOF
  after 0-reads to be able to return error properly.

- libssh2_session_methods.3: detail what can be asked for

- compression: send zlib before none
  
  As the list of algorithms in a preferred order we should send zlib
  before none to increase the chances that the server will let us do
  compression.

- compress: faster check, better return codes
  
  In the transport functions we avoid a strcmp() now and just check a
  boolean instead.
  
  The compress/decompress function's return code is now acknowledged and
  used as actual return code in case of failures.

- libssh2_session_handshake: replaces libssh2_session_startup()
  
  The function libssh2_session_startup() is now considered deprecated due
  to the portability issue with the socket argument.
  libssh2_session_handshake() is the name of the replacement.

- libssh2_socket_t: now externally visible
  
  In preparation for upcominig changes, the libssh2_socket_t type is now
  typedef'ed in the public header.

- _libssh2_transport_drain: removed
  
  This function proved not to be used nor useful.

- _libssh2_channel_write: don't iterate over transport writes
  
  When a call to _libssh2_transport_write() succeeds, we must return from
  _libssh2_channel_write() to allow the caller to provide the next chunk
  of data.
  
  We cannot move on to send the next piece of data that may already have
  been provided in this same function call, as we risk getting EAGAIN for
  that and we can't return information both about sent data as well as
  EAGAIN. So, by returning short now, the caller will call this function
  again with new data to send.

- _libssh2_transport_write: updated documentation blurb

- _libssh2_transport_write: remove fprintf remainder
  
  Mistake from previous debugging

- session: improved errors
  
  Replaced -1/SOCKET_NONE errors with appropriate error defines instead.
  
  Made the verbose trace output during banner receiving less annoying for
  non-blocking sessions.

- crypt_init: use correct error define

- _libssh2_error: hide EAGAIN for non-blocking sessions
  
  In an attempt to make the trace output less cluttered for non-blocking
  sessions the error function now avoids calling the debug function if the
  error is the EAGAIN and the session is non-blocking.

- agent: use better error defines

- comp_method_zlib_init: use correct error defines

- transport: better error codes
  
  LIBSSH2_SOCKET_NONE (-1) should no longer be used as error code as it is
  (too) generic and we should instead use specific and dedicated error
  codes to better describe the error.

- channel: return code and _libssh2_error cleanup
  
  Made sure that all transport_write() call failures get _libssh2_error
  called.

- _libssh2_channel_write: limit to 32700 bytes
  
  The well known and used ssh server Dropbear has a maximum SSH packet
  length at 32768 by default. Since the libssh2 design current have a
  fixed one-to-one mapping from channel_write() to the packet size created
  by transport_write() the previous limit of 32768 in the channel layer
  caused the transport layer to create larger packets than 32768 at times
  which Dropbear rejected forcibly (by closing the connection).
  
  The long term fix is of course to remove the hard relation between the
  outgoing SSH packet size and what the input length argument is in the
  transport_write() function call.

- libssh.h: add more dedicated error codes

- SCP: allow file names with bytes > 126
  
  When parsing the SCP protocol and verifying that the data looks like a
  valid file name, byte values over 126 must not be consider illegal since
  UTF-8 file names will use such codes.

  Removed Win32 ifdef completely for sys/uio.h.
  
  No idea why we had this ifdef at all but MSVC, MingW32, Watcom
  and Borland all have no sys/uio.h header; so if there's another
  Win32 compiler which needs it then it should be added explicitely
  instead of this negative list.

- Use the new libssh2.rc file.

- Added resource file for libssh2.dll (shamelessly stolen from libcurl).

- Updated Win32 MSVC dependencies versions.

- Added include for sys/select.h to get fd.set on some platforms.

- Added Watcom makefile borrowed from libcurl.
  
  This makefile compiles already all files fine for static lib, but needs
  final touch when I have OpenSSL fully working with shared libs and Watcom.

- Added copyright define to libssh2.h and use it for binary builds.

- Moved version defines up in order to include from .rc file.
  
  Blocked rest of header with ifndef so its possible to let
  the rc compiler only use the version defines.

- Some minor makefile tweaks.

Daniel Stenberg (2 Aug 2010)
- example: treat the libssh2_channel_read() return code properly
  
  A short read is not an error. Only negative values are errors!

- libssh2_wait_socket: reset error code to "leak" EAGAIN less
  
  Since libssh2 often sets LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN internally before
  _libssh2_wait_socket is called, we can decrease some amount of
  confusion in user programs by resetting the error code in this function
  to reduce the risk of EAGAIN being stored as error when a blocking
  function returns.

- _libssh2_wait_socket: poll needs milliseconds
  
  As reported on the mailing list, the code path using poll() should
  multiple seconds with 1000 to get milliseconds, not divide!
  
  Reported by: Jan Van Boghout

- typedef: make ssize_t get typedef without LIBSSH2_WIN32
  
  The condition around the ssize_t typedef depended on both LIBSSH2_WIN32
  *and* _MSC_VER being defined when it should be enough to depend on
  _MSC_VER only. It also makes it nicer so libssh2-using code builds fine
  without having custom defines.

  session_free: free more data to avoid memory leaks

- channel_free: ignore problems with channel_close()
  
  As was pointed out in bug #182, we must not return failure from
  _libssh2_channel_free() when _libssh2_channel_close() returns an error
  that isn't EAGAIN. It can effectively cause the function to never go
  through, like it did now in the case where the socket was actually
  closed but socket_state still said LIBSSH2_SOCKET_CONNECTED.
  
  I consider this fix the right thing as it now also survives other
  errors, even if making sure socket_state isn't lying is also a good
  idea.

- publickey_list_free: no return value from a void function
  
  Fixed a compiler warning I introduced previously when checking input
  arguments more. I also added a check for the other pointer to avoid NULL
  pointer dereferences.

  handshake: Compression enabled at the wrong time
  
  In KEXINIT messages, the client and server agree on, among other
  things, whether to use compression. This method agreement occurs
  in src/kex.c's kex_agree_methods() function. However, if
  compression is enabled (either client->server, server->client, or
  both), then the compression layer is initialized in
  kex_agree_methods() -- before NEWKEYS has been received.
  
  Instead, the initialization of the compression layer should
  happen after NEWKEYS has been received. This looks to occur
  insrc/kex.c's diffie_hellman_sha1(), which even has the comment:
  
      /* The first key exchange has been performed,
  
          switch to active crypt/comp/mac mode */
  
  There, after NEWKEYS is received, the cipher and mac algorithms
  are initialized, and that is where the compression should be
  initialized as well.
  
  The current implementation fails if server->client compression is
  enabled because most server implementations follow OpenSSH's
  lead, where compression is initialized after NEWKEYS. Since the
  server initializes compression after NEWKEYS, but libssh2
  initializes compression after KEXINIT (i.e. before NEWKEYS), they
  are out of sync.
  
  Reported in bug report #180

  userauth_hostbased_fromfile: packet length too short
  
  The packet length calculated in src/userauth.c's
  userauth_hostbased_fromfile() function is too short by 4 bytes;
  it forgets to add four bytes for the length of the hostname.
  This causes hostbased authentication to fail, since the server
  will read junk data.
  
  verified against proftpd's mod_sftp module

- _libssh2_userauth_publickey: reject method names longer than the data
  
  This functions get the method length by looking at the first 32
  bit of data, and I now made it not accept method lengths that are
  longer than the whole data set is, as given in the dedicated
  function argument.
  
  This was detected when the function was given bogus public key
  data as an ascii string, which caused the first 32bits to create
  a HUGE number.

- NULL resistance: make more public functions survive NULL pointer input
  
  Sending in NULL as the primary pointer is now dealt with by more
  public functions. I also narrowed the userauth.c code somewhat to
  stay within 80 columns better.

- agent: make libssh2_agent_userauth() work blocking properly
  
  previously it would always work in a non-blocking manner

  LIBSSH2_DEBUG: macro uses incorrect function variable
  
  The LIBSSH2_DEBUG macro, defined in libssh2_priv.h, incorrectly uses the
  function variable ssh_msg_disconnect when it should use ssh_msg_debug.
  
  This shows that the LIBSSH2_CALLBACK_DEBUG callback never has worked...

- warning: fix a compiler warning 'pointer differs in signedness'
  
  As reported in bug #177

- portability: introduce LIBSSH2_INT64_T_FORMAT for 64bit printf()s
  
  As pointed out in bug #177, some of the Windows compilers use
  %I64 to output 64 bit variables with the printf family.

- debug: avoid sending NULL to sprintf %s
  
  Via the _libssh2_debug() macro/function. Pointed out by john in bug report

- sftp docs: show macro on macro page, only function on function page
  
  The individual man pages for macros now show the full convenience
  macro as defined, and then the man page for the actual function
  only shows the function.

- code police: make the code use less than 80 columns

- libssh2_channel_write_ex: remove macros, added wording on buffer size

- libssh2_sftp_write: document buffer size and changed some ordering

- libssh2_channel_write_stderr: show how the macro is defined

- libssh2_channel_write: show how the macro is defined

- SFTP: limit write() to not produce overly large packets
  
  sftp_write() now limits how much data it gets at a time even more
  than before. Since this function creates a complete outgoing
  packet based on what gets passed to it, it is crucial that it
  doesn't create too large packets.
  
  With this method, there's also no longer any problem to use very
  large buffers in your application and feed that to libssh2. I've
  done numerous tests now with uploading data over SFTP using 100K
  buffers and I've had no problems with that.

- scp_write_nonblock: add transfer time info
  
  Using the same timing logic and output format as
  sftp_write_nonblock allows us to very easily run benchmarks on
  SCP vs SFTP uploads using libssh2.

- sftp_write_nonblock: select() on socket, use *BIG* buffer, time transfer
  
  The select() is just to make it nicer so that it doesn't
  crazy-loop on EAGAIN. The buffer size thing is mostly to verify
  that this really work as supposed.
  
  Transfer timing is just a minor thing, but it can just as well be
  there and help us time and work on performance easier using out
  of the box examples.

- agent: use _libssh2_error() when returning errors
  
  As pointed out in bug report #173, this module basically never
  used _libssh2_error() which made it work inconstently with other
  parts of the libssh2 code base. This is my first take at making
  this code more in line with the rest.

- inputchecks: make lots of API functions check for NULL pointers
  
  If an application accidentally provides a NULL handle pointer to
  the channel or sftp public functions, they now return an error
  instead of segfaulting.

- libssh2_channel_eof: clarify that it returns negative on errors

- SFTP: keep the sftp error code as 32 bit
  
  'last_errno' holds to the error code from the SFTP protocol and
  since that is 32 bits on the wire there's no point in using a
  long for this internally which is larger on some platforms.

- agent: make the code better deal with unexpected code flows
  
  agent->ops gets initialized by the libssh2_agent_connect() call
  but we need to make sure that we don't segfault even if a bad
  sequence of function calls is used.

- SFTP: fail init SFTP if session isn't authenticated
  
  Alexander Lamaison filed bug #172
  (http://trac.libssh2.org/ticket/172), and pointed out that SFTP
  init would do bad if the session isn't yet authenticated at the
  time of the call, so we now check for this situation and returns
  an error if detected. Calling sftp_init() at this point is bad
  usage to start with.

- direct_tcpip: bring back inclusion of libssh2_config.h
  
  In order to increase portability of this example, I'm bringing
  the inclusion of libssh2_config.h back, and I also added an
  require that header for this example to compile.
  
  I also made all code lines fit within 80 columns.

Guenter Knauf (3 Jun 2010)
- cast away a warning.

- moved CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE define up so its defined before the winsock headers are included.

- removed MSVC ifdef since seems we can use __int64 still with latest headers.

- changed copyright notice for MinW32 and NetWare binaries.

- cleaned up MSVC ifdefs which where spreaded over 3 places.

- added uint8_t typedef for NetWare CLIB platform.

- if the function declaration gets changed the header should be changed too.

- this is MSVC specific and doesnt apply for all Win32 compilers;

- statvfs: use libssh2_sftp_statvfs only, no "_ex"
  
  As the long-term goal is to get rid of the extensive set of

  new macros when we add new functions. Therefore we let the
  function be libssh2_sftp_statvfs() plainly without using an _ex
  suffix.
  
  I also made it use size_t instead of unsigned int for the string
  length as that too is a long-term goal for the API.

- added to tarball: libssh2_knownhost_checkp.3

- knownhost: support [host]:port in knownhost file
  
  OpenSSH has ways to add hosts to the knownhosts file that include
  a specific port number which makes the key associated with only
  that specific host+port pair. libssh2 previously did not support
  this, and I was forced to add a new function to the API to
  properly expose this ability to applications:
  libssh2_knownhost_checkp()
  
  To *add* such hosts to the knownhosts file, you make sure to pass
  on the host name in that manner to the libssh2_knownhost_addc()
  function.

- init/exit: mention these were added in 1.2.5

- libssh2_knownhost_check docs: correct the prototype

- examples: avoid use of uninitialized variable 'sock'

- KEX: stop pretending we negotiate language
  
  There was some stub-like parts of an implementation for
  implementing kex language negotiation that caused clang-analyzer
  to warn and as it did nothing I've now removed the dead code.

- ssh2_agent: avoid using 'session' uninitialized on failures

- examples: remove assignments of variable rc that's never used

- publickey_init: remove useless variable increment

- hostkey_method_ssh_rsa_init: remove useless variable increment

- packet_x11_open: removed useless variable increment
  
  and made the declaration of a variable more local

- packet_queue_listener: removed useless variable increment
  
  and made the declaration of a variable more local

- sftp_read: move a read_responses array to where its used
  
  I find that this increases readability since the array is used
  only in the function call just immediately below and nowhere
  else.

- sftp_readdir: turn a small array static const and move it

- sftp_attrsize: converted function to a macro
  
  This way, the macro can evaluate a static number at compile time
  for two out of four uses, and it probably runs faster for the
  other two cases too.

- sftp_open: deal with short channel_write calls
  
  This was an old TODO that just wasn't done before. If
  channel_write returns short, that is not an error.

- sftp_open: clean up, better check of input data
  
  The clang-analyzer report made it look into this function and
  I've went through it to remove a potential use of an
  uninitialized variable and I also added some validation of input
  data received from the server.
  
  In general, lots of more code in this file need to validate the
  input before assuming it is correct: there are servers out there
  that have bugs or just have another idea of how to do the SFTP
  protocol.

- bugfix: avoid using the socket if it failed to create one

- bugfix: potential use of NULL pointer

- libssh2_userauth_password_ex: clarify errors somewhat
  
  The errors mentioned in this man page are possible return codes
  but not necessarily the only return codes that this can return.
  
  Also reformatted the typ prototypes somewhat.

- examples: fixed and made them more similar
  
  The channel read/write functions can return 0 in legitimate cases
  without it being an error, and we need to loop properly if they
  return short.

  VMS port of libssh2; changes in the libssh2 common code

- Makefile: added the two news headers userauth.h and session.h

- cleanup: prefer the internal functions
  
  To get the blocking vs non-blocking to work as smooth as possible
  and behave better internally, we avoid using the external
  interfaces when calling functions internally.
  
  Renamed a few internal functions to use _libssh2 prefix when not
  being private within a file, and removed the libssh2_ for one
  that was private within the file.

- session_free: remove dead code

- libssh2_publickey_init: fixed to work better non-blocking
  
  This was triggered by a clang-analyzer complaint that turned out
  to be valid, and it made me dig deeper and fix some generic non-
  blocking problems I disovered in the code.
  
  While cleaning this up, I moved session-specific stuff over to a
  new session.h header from the libssh2_priv.h header.

- channel: reduce duplicated free and returns
  
  Simplified the code by trying to free data and return on a single
  spot.

- channel: make variables more local
  
  By making 'data' and 'data_len' more local in several places in
  this file it will be easier to spot how they are used and we'll
  get less risks to accidentally do bad things with them.

- Fix typos in manpages, catched by Lintian

Daniel Stenberg (24 Apr 2010)
- channel_request_pty: simplify the code
  
  clang-analyzer pointed out how 'data' could be accessed as a NULL

  happen in real-life the code flow is easier to read and follow by
  moving the LIBSSH2_FREE() call into the block that is supposed to
  deal with the data pointer anyway.

- libssh2_channel_process_startup: simplify the code
  
  clang-analyzer pointed out how 'data' could be accessed as a NULL
  pointer if the wrong state was set, and while I don't see that
  happen in real-life the code flow is easier to read and follow by
  moving the LIBSSH2_FREE() call into the block that is supposed to
  deal with the data pointer anyway.

- sftp_close_handle: add precation to not access NULL pointer
  
  clang-analyzer pointed this out as a "Pass-by-value argument in
  function call is undefined" but while I can't see exactly how
  this can ever happen in reality I think a little check for safety
  isn't such a bad thing here.

- scp_write_nonblock: Value stored to 'nread' is never read

- scp_write: Value stored to 'ptr' is never read

- scp_write_nonblock: Value stored to 'ptr' is never read

- sftp_mkdir: less silly output but show failures

- [Jose Baars brought this change]

  VMS port of libssh2 including VMS specific build procedures

- two variable types changes, made lines less than 80 columns
  
  The two variable type changes are only to match type variable
  fields actually read from the binary protocol.

- remove check for negative padding_length
  
  It was silly, since it is read as an unsigned char...

- hostkey_method_ssh_dss_init: Value stored to 's' is never read

- libssh2_banner_set: avoid unnecessary increment and explain code

- agent_transact_unix: remove unused variable

- remove two unnecessary increments

- more code converted to use _libssh2_store_*()

- libssh2_publickey_list_fetch: removed unused variables

- libssh2_publickey_init: remove unused variables

- libssh2_scp_send64: added to API to provide large file transfers
  
  The previously existing libssh2_scp_send_ex() function has no way
  to send files that are larger than 'size_t' which on 32bit
  systems mean 4GB. This new API uses a libssh2_int64_t type and
  should thus on most modern systems be able to send enormous
  files.

- sftp_init: remove unused variables and assignments

- libssh2_knownhost_check: Value stored to 'keylen' is never read

- hostkey: fix compiler warning

- remove unused variable

- data types: convert more to use size_t and uint32_t

- channel: variable type cleanups

- cleanups: better binary packet gen, size_t fixes and PACKET_* removal
  
  I'll introduce a new internal function set named
  
   _libssh2_store_u32
   _libssh2_store_u64
   _libssh2_store_str
  
  That can be used all through the library to build binary outgoing
  packets.  Using these instead of the current approach removes
  hundreds of lines from the library while at the same time greatly
  enhances readability. I've not yet fully converted everything to
  use these functions.
  
  I've converted LOTS of 'unsigned long' to 'size_t' where
  data/string lengths are dealt with internally. This is The Right
  Thing and it will help us make the transition to our
  size_t-polished API later on as well.
  
  I'm removing the PACKET_* error codes. They were originally
  introduced as a set of separate error codes from the transport
  layer, but having its own set of errors turned out to be very
  awkward and they were then converted into a set of #defines that
  simply maps them to the global libssh2 error codes instead. Now,
  I'l take the next logical step and simply replace the PACKET_*
  defines with the actual LIBSSH2_ERROR_* defines. It will increase
  readability and decrease confusion.
  
  I also separated packet stuff into its own packet.h header file.

- clarified the return code

- rename libssh2_error to the correct _libssh2_error
  
  We reserve ^libssh2_ for public symbols and we use _libssh2 as
  prefix for internal ones. I fixed the intendation of all these
  edits with emacs afterwards, which then changed it slightly more
  than just _libssh2_error() expressions but I didn't see any
  obvious problems.

- data type cleanup: made lots of code use size_t etc
  
  A lot of code used 'unsigned long' and the likes when it should
  rather just use plain 'int' or use size_t for data lengths.

- wait_socket: make c89 compliant and use two fd_sets for select()

- sftp_readdir: always zero terminate, detail the return code
  
  I also added a description for the 'longentry' field which was
  previously undocumented!

- sftp_readdir: simplified and bugfixed
  
  This function no longer has any special purpose code for the
  single entry case, as it was pointless.
  
  The previous code would overflow the buffers with an off-by-one
  in case the file name or longentry data fields received from the
  server were exactly as long as the buffer provided to
  libssh2_sftp_readdir_ex.
  
  We now make sure that libssh2_sftp_readdir_ex() ALWAYS zero
  terminate the buffers it fills in.
  
  The function no longer calls the libssh2_* function again, but
  properly uses the internal sftp_* instead.

- channel/transport: we now drain the outgoing send buffer when we ignore EAGAIN
  
  When we ignore the EAGAIN from the transport layer within channel_write, we
  now drain the outgoing transport layer buffer so that remainders in that
  won't cause any problems in the next invoke of _libssh2_transport_write()

- channel_write: if data has been sent, don't return EAGAIN
  
  When sending data in a loop, we must not return EAGAIN if we
  managed to send data in an earlier round. This was reported in
  bug #126 => http://libssh2.stuge.se/ticket/126

Daniel Stenberg (13 Apr 2010)
- channel_close: no longer wait for the SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE message
  
  As the packet may simply not arrive we cannot have the close
  function wait for it unconditionally.

- less code duplication in the poll vs select code flows
  
  libssh2_keepalive_send and libssh2_session_block_directions are
  now used outside of the #ifdef blocks.

- make it C90 compliant

- updated with all changes and bugs since 1.2.4

- Added LIBSSH2_SFTP_S_IS***() macros and updated docs
  
  libssh2_sftp_fstat_ex.3 is now extended quite a lot to describe a
  lot of the struct and the bits it uses and how to test for them.

- sftp_init() deal with _libssh2_channel_write() returns short
  
  When _libssh2_channel_write() is asked to send off 9 bytes, the
  code needs to deal with the situation where less than 9 bytes
  were sent off and prepare to send the remaining piece at a later
  time.

- handle a NULL password as if it was ""
  
  libssh2_userauth_publickey_fromfile_ex() takes a "passphrase"
  but didn't deal with it being set to NULL.

- Reduce used window sizes by factor 10
  
  As reported in bug report #166 http://libssh2.stuge.se/ticket/166
  by 'ptjm', the maximum window size must be less crazy for libssh2
  to do better with more server implementations. I did not do any
  testing to see how this changes raw SCP performance, but the
  maximum window size is still almost 4MB. This also has the upside
  that libssh2 will use less memory.

Peter Stuge (28 Mar 2010)
- Correctly clear blocking flag after sending multipart packet
  
  commit 7317edab61d2179febc38a2c2c4da0b951d74cbc cleared the outbound
  blocking bit when send_existing() returned PACKET_NONE and *ret=0, as
  opposed to before even calling send_existing(), but because *ret=1 when
  sending parts 2..n of an existing packet, the bit would only be cleared
  when calling libssh2_transport_write() for a new packet.
  
  Clear the direction flag after the final part of a packet has been sent.

Daniel Stenberg (24 Mar 2010)
- Added man page for libssh2_knownhost_addc()
  
  Added mention in libssh2_knownhost_add() docs that
  libssh2_knownhost_addc() is the preferred function now.

- at next soname bump remove libssh2_knownhost_add()

- ignore TAGS ("make tags" makes them)

- fix memory leak
  
  we must not assign the pointer a NULL since it keeps allocated
  data and at least parts of an error string

- fixed the pattern for avoiding the poll check
  
  added some comments about known problems with poll on darwin

- avoid checking for poll on some systems
  
  darwin and interix are known to have broken poll implementations
  so we skip the check on those and thus have them use select
  unconditionally

- ignore libssh2.dsp

- removed libssh2_error()'s forth argument
  
  libssh2_error() no longer allocates a string and only accepts a const

  return libssh2_error(...) instead of having one call to
  libssh2_error() and then a separate return call. In several of those
  cases I then also changed the former -1 return code to a more
  detailed one - something that I think will not change behaviors
  anywhere but it's worth keeping an eye open for any such.

  Other common clients send and receive EOF before closing, there are no
  drawbacks, and some servers need it to work correctly.

Alexander Lamaison (26 Feb 2010)
- Style improvements to knownhost error handling.
  
  Made improvements as suggested by Peter Stuge: http://www.libssh2.org/mail/libssh2-devel-archive-2010-02/0161.shtml.

- Call libssh2_error for every knownhost API failure.
  
  The libssh2 API calls should set the last error code and a message when
  returning a failure by calling libssh2_error.  This changeset adds these
  calls to the libssh2_knownhost_* API as well as libssh2_base64_decode.
  
  This change also makes libssh2_error into a function rather than a macro.
  Its implementation is moved to misc.c.  This function returns the error
  code passed to it allowing callers to return the error value directly
  without duplicating the error code.

- Fix LIBSSH2_ALLOC checks.
  
  These appear to be cut-and paste errors where the wrong variable is checked
  for NULLness after calling LIBSSH2_ALLOC.

Simon Josefsson (23 Feb 2010)
- Silence compiler warning.

- Make it portable; test uses = for string comparison (not ==).  Indent.

Alexander Lamaison (22 Feb 2010)
- libssh2_knownhost_del: fix write to freed memory.
  
  When removing a known host, libssh2_knownhost_del would remove the node from the linked list, free its memory and then overwrite the struct parameter (which indicated which node to remove) with 0.  However, this struct is actually allocated within the just-freed node meaning we're writing to freed memory.  This made Windows very upset.
  
  The fix is simply to overwrite the struct first before freeing the memory.

Daniel Stenberg (21 Feb 2010)
- show more verbose error when SCP send fails

- libssh2_socket_t is done, a library-free function is needed

- clarify that this frees all data associated with a session

- improved error handling

- add missing libssh2_error() calls
  
  To make sure the public API is functional and that the
  BLOCK_ADJUST_ERRNO() macro works correctly we MUST make sure to
  call libssh2_error() when we return errors.

- fix memory leak in userauth_keyboard_interactive()
  
  Mr anonymous in bug #125 pointed out that the userauth_keyboard_interactive()
  function does in fact assign the same pointer a second time to a new allocated
  buffer without properly freeing the previous one, which caused a memory leak.

- added missing error codes
  
  To allow the libssh2_session_last_error() function to work as
  documented, userauth_password() now better makes sure to call
  libssh2_error() everywhere before it returns error.

  to A) make it easier to figure out what each function/macro actually
  is for so that automated lookups work better and for B) make sure we
  have all public functions document (both macros and functions) to
  make it easier for us to work away from all the macros in a future
  release.

- Correctly check for an invalid socket in session_startup()

- Small documentation fix after Dave's _USERAUTH_FAILURE improvement

- [Dave McCaldon brought this change]

  Handle SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE for password and kbd-int authentication
  
  Neither libssh2_userauth_password_ex() nor
  libssh2_userauth_keyboard_interactive_ex() would return a login failure
  error if the server responded with a SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE, instead
  you would see whatever previous error had occurred, typically
  LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN.
  
  This patch changes error code -18 to LIBSSH2_ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED
  and makes LIBSSH2_ERROR_PUBLICKEY_UNRECOGNIZED an alias for
  LIBSSH2_ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED.  In addition, new logic in
  userauth_password() properly handles SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE and both
  this function and userauth_keyboard_interactive() now properly return
  LIBSSH2_ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED.

- [Dave McCaldon brought this change]

  Fix trace context lookup in libssh2_debug()
  
  The trace context is actually a bitmask so that tracing output can be
  controlled by setting a bitmask using libssh2_trace().  However, the logic
  in libssh2_debug() that converted the context to a string was using the
  context value as an array index.  Because the code used a bounds check on
  the array, there was never a danger of a crash, but you would certainly
  either get the wrong string, or "unknown".
  
  This patch adds a lookup that iterates over the context strings and uses
  it's index to check for the corresponding bit in the context.

- Simplify the commit 63457dfa using type cast from size_t * to ulong *.

Alexander Lamaison (30 Dec 2009)
- Fixed memory leak in userauth_publickey().
  
  userauth_publickey_fromfile() reads the key from a
  file using file_read_publickey() which returns two
  allocated strings, the decoded key and the key
  method (such as "ssh-dss").  The latter can be
  derived from the former but returning both avoids a
  later allocation while doing so.
  
  Older versions of userauth_publickey_fromfile() used
  this method string directly but when
  userauth_publickey() was factored out of
  userauth_publickey_fromfile() it derived the method
  from the key itself.  This resulted in the method
  being allocated twice.
  
  This fix, which maintains the optimisation that
  avoids an extra allocation, changes
  userauth_publickey() so it doesn't allocate and
  derive the method when userauth_pblc_method already
  has a value.

  Helpful in debugging the -39 errors.

- Another transport layer fix for bogus -39 (LIBSSH2_ERROR_BAD_USE) errors
  
  Commit 683aa0f6b52fb1014873c961709102b5006372fc made send_existing() send
  more than just the second part of a packet when the kernel did not accept
  the full packet, but the function still overlooked the SSH protocol
  overhead in each packet, often 48 bytes.
  
  If only the last few bytes of a packet remained, then the packet would
  erroneously be considered completely sent, and the next call to write
  more data in the session would return a -39 error.

- move local variable to be more localized

- fixed some indent mistakes

- Fix padding in ssh-dss signature blob encoding
  
  DSA signatures consist of two 160-bit integers called r and s. In ssh-dss
  signature blobs r and s are stored directly after each other in binary
  representation, making up a 320-bit (40 byte) string. (See RFC4253 p14.)
  
  The crypto wrappers in libssh2 would either pack r and s incorrectly, or
  fail, when at least one integer was small enough to be stored in 19 bytes
  or less.
  
  The patch ensures that r and s are always stored as two 160 bit numbers.

- Don't always clear write direction blocking flag
  
  When libssh2_transport_write() is called to continue sending a
  partially sent packet the write direction flag must not be cleared
  until the previous packet has been completely sent, or the app would
  hang if the packet still isn't sent completely, since select() gets
  called by the internal blocking emulation layer in libssh2 but would
  then not be watching the socket for writability.
  
  Clear the flag only once processing of previous packet data is
  complete and a new packet is about to be prepared.
