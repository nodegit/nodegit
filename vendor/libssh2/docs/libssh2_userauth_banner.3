.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <libssh2.h>

int
libssh2_userauth_banner(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, char **banner);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsession\fP - Session instance as returned by
.BR libssh2_session_init_ex(3)

\fIbanner\fP - Should point to a pointer that gets filled with banner message.

After an authentication has been attempted, such as a
\fBSSH_USERAUTH_NONE\fP request sent by
.BR libssh2_userauth_list(3) ,
this function can be called to retrieve the userauth banner sent by
the server. If no such banner is sent, or if an authentication has not
yet been attempted, returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_MISSING_USERAUTH_BANNER.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success returns 0 and an UTF-8 NUL-terminated string is stored in the
\fIbanner\fP. This string is internally managed by libssh2 and will be
deallocated upon session termination.
On failure returns
LIBSSH2_ERROR_MISSING_USERAUTH_BANNER.
