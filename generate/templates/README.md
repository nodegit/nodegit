# Manual templates

Manual templates override generated code from nodegit while generating source code. They really should be avoid untill absolutely necessary.

## Why?

#### 1. Performance

> Everytime the library switches between C land and the javascript thread, there is a penalty in performance. If in practice the usage of a method in libgit2 requires crossing the c/javascript boundary frequently, it might be better option to use manual templates. An example being `Revwalk::FastWalk`.

#### 2. Saftey

> The generated code sometimes does not handle structures that are interdependent. An example would be `git_patch` and `git_diff`. A `git_patch`'s memory is owned by `git_diff`, and that includes all of the children of `git_patch`, as well. So a `git_diff_hunk`, `git_diff_line`, and `git_patch` all are owned by a `git_diff`, and when that `git_diff` is deleted, all the memory for any patches, hunks, or lines that are in use as NodeGitWrappers are now corrupted. Further, a `git_diff` keeps a file handle open for its entire lifespan, which can lead to NodeGit holding onto file locks in Windows. Due to both of these compounding issues, we wrote manual templates to shift ownership away from a `git_diff` to `git_patch`, `git_diff_hunk`, and `git_diff_line` and also shorten the lifespan of a diff.

#### 3. Odd cases

> If a new pattern exists in libgit that would be difficult to implement using generated code, manual templates can be used for one-off cases. Typically generated code takes care of most patterns seen in libgit, but if function signatures do not follow typical pattern, manual templates could be used. Example: `git_filter` and `git_remote_ls`.

## Implementing manual templates

#### 1. Write manual .cc and .h files to _generate/templates/manual/_

    *.cc files -> /generate/templates/manual/src/
    *.h files -> /generate/templates/manual/include/

#### 2. Remove all references from /generate configuration files

#### 3. Add references to binding.gyp template

    location: /generate/templates/templates/binding.gyp

#### 4. Add headers to nodegit.cc template

    location: /generate/templates/templates/nodegit.cc

#### 5. Add new wrapper to nodegit.js template

    use rawApi.ManualWrapper reference to add _ManualWrapper
    add any js wrapper (if any) via importExtension
